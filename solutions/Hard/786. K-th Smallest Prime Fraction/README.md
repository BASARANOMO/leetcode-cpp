## Solution1

Sort

Time complexity: `O(n^2 logn)`

Space complexity: `O(n^2)`

## Solution2

Priority queue

Time complexity: `O(k logn)`

Space complexity: `O(n)`

## Solution3

Two pointers + binary search

Time complexity: `O(n logC)` where `C` is the max val of elements in `arr`

Space complexity: `O(1)`
