# 397. Integer Replacement

## Solution1

DFS

Time complexity: `O(phi ^ log n)` with `phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 = 1.618`

Space complexity: `O(log n)`

## Solution2

DFS + memorization

Time complexity: `O(log n)`

Space complexity: `O(log n)`

## Solution3

Greedy

Time complexity: `O(log n)`

Space complexity: `O(1)`
