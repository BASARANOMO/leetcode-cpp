## Solution1

Priority queue (min heap)

Time complexity: `O(log n!)`

Space complexity: `O(n)`

## Solution1bis

Max heap

Time complexity: `O(n log k)`

Space complexity: `O(k)`

## Solution2

Sort

Time complexity: `O(n log n)`

Space complexity: `O(log n)`

## Solution3

Quicksort

Time complexity: Expectation `O(n)`; Worst case `O(n^2)`

Space complexity: Expecatation `O(log n)`; Worst case `O(n)`
